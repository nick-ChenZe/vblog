What, exactly, do the Minnesota Timberwolves have in rookie point guard Tyus Jones?

森林狼到达想从泰厄斯-琼斯这名年轻的控卫身上得到什么？

At this stage in his career, Jones' game is in an unformed state; who knows what his ceiling and role will be when the dust settles. In 37 appearances this season, Jones showed flashes of being a productive offensive player and game manager, but those flashes can only be so bright when a player has logged less than 600 minutes (1,000 is the typical arbitrary number before conclusions can start to be drawn). So, needless to say, not much is really known about Jones at the NBA level as of today. What is relatively known, however, is that what he lacks in athleticism he makes up for in cerebral play.

在琼斯的刚开始的职业生涯中，他一直未被定型，谁又能知道一切尘埃落定后，他在这支青年军中能爆发出多大的能量，扮演怎么样的角色。在它出场的37场比赛中，琼斯展现出了成为一名高效的侵略性的球员和球场组织者，但是这些片段只有在这小于600分钟的样本中才看上去亮眼（客观上需要1000分钟，我们才能对这个球员下结论）。不用说，如今关于琼斯在NBA这个水平的职业联赛的还未被详知。但是，我们能知道的是，在他当做大脑游戏来玩的竞技比赛中到底缺乏些什么。

Basketball IQ is a nebulous factor of gameplay that is difficult to ascribe data to; it's more often left to the eye to pick up on and, from what he has shown thus far, Jones has "it." As can be seen in this video from a game (albeit a preseason game) against the Bulls, he just knows when to make the right pass, when to pull up in transition, and when to kick it out on a drive.

球商（Basketball IQ）是这个比赛中很模糊而且很难被数据所形容的一个因素；大多是情况需要我们自己用眼睛去看,而从琼斯迄今为止所有的比赛中观察，他是一个高情商的球员。像下面这场对公年的比赛录像中可以看到，他知道什么时候传球，什么时候在转换进攻何时该停下来控制节奏，什么时候面对球员跑位时该如何阻断进攻。

Jones' high basketball IQ is his greatest strength and he will most likely have to rely on that innate intelligence in order to be successful in the NBA. He possesses a skill that rarely, if ever, can be taught over the course of a career.

琼斯高情商是他最大的优势，他如果想要在NBA立足，一定要靠这与生俱来的天赋。如果可能的话，在一个赛季后磨炼后，他能充分发挥这项为数不多的能力。

Along with his high basketball IQ, Jones displayed the ability to hit the three during his only year at Duke, where he shot 37.9 percent; however, that consistency didn't translate to this season. After starting a blistering 13 for 26, Jones converted only three of his final 27 attempts to finish the season with a woeful 30.2% from three. However, it's possible that that late season skid could represent bad luck more than his overall talent. With the way the game emphasizes the three-point shot as the focal point of many offenses, Jones should be able to find a nice niche within the league if he can shoot at least league average (typically around 35%) from behind the arc.

除了高情商以外，琼斯在杜克仅有的一年大学比赛中，展现出了三分远射能力，投出了37.9%的三分球命中率；但是，这些并没有延续到这个赛季的比赛中。在开赛爆种26投13中后，之后至的27次出手只命中了3球，以糟糕的30.2%的命中率收尾整的赛季。但是，很有可能，赛季末的状态打滑对于他的天赋来说只是有那么点不幸。比赛分析显示，三分出手已经成为了比赛对抗中非常重要的武器，在这种节奏下琼斯应该能够在这个联盟中找到一个很好位置，如果它能够在三分线外投出不少于联盟平均水平的命中率（一般在35%左右）。

However, today's game also emphasizes shots near the rim, so it is imperative that Jones learns to finish better 10 feet and in, where he only converted 45.6% of his attempts. Nearly half (43.6% according to NBA.com) of his shot attempts this past season occurred within 8-feet of the hoop.

但是，如今的比赛同样强调能在篮筐附近投篮，所以对于琼斯来说当务之急是学会在10英尺甚至更近的距离终结球，在这个位置本赛季它只有45.6%的命中率。 这个半个赛季，琼斯的投篮近半数（根据NBA.com，43.6%的出手）的投篮尝试在距离篮筐八英尺内。

Jones is a decent rebounder for a guy of his size (3.0 rebounds per 36, according to Basketball Reference) and a strong passer. Passing data (according to NBA.com) suggests that Jones does a good job of putting his teammates in a position to score. The data looks at how frequently Jones passed to each player on the team and their various shooting percentages after said passes.

对于琼斯这种身材而言（琼斯身高6尺1），他还是个出色篮板手（根据Basketball Reference官网统计，每36分钟，可以摘得3.0个篮板）和优秀的传球人。传球数据（据 NBA.com统计）显示琼斯能够很好地帮助他的队员在更好的位置去得分。数据显示，琼斯是如何频繁的向每个队友传导球，同时在这种穿针引线下他们命中率发生的改变。

Again, the sample size is small, but Nemanja Bjelica ("pass to" frequency of 14.3%) and Shabazz Muhammad ("pass to" frequency of 15.7%) shot 54.5% and 53.0% respectively from the field after receiving a pass from Jones, while Zach LaVine ("pass to" frequency of 16.8%) shot 46.7% from three. It is difficult to draw definitive conclusions from this data as the number of shot attempts was low due to Jones' limited minutes this season, but they may be at least a somewhat decent indicator of how Jones puts his teammates in a position to be dangerous with the ball. Rebounding and passing are important tools to have in any point guard's toolbox, but especially for one who projects to be an important player off the bench.

再次声明，数据样本很小，但是内马尼亚-别利察（占传球比率14.3%）和沙巴兹-穆罕默德（占传球比率15.7%）在球场上接到琼斯的传球后，分别投出了54.5%和53.0的命中率。同时，扎克拉文（占传球比率）投出了46.7%的三分球命中率。由于琼斯本赛季的上场时间有限，这样的投篮尝试数量很少，我们很难从这份数据中总结出明确的结论，但是它们至少是一个很好的例证来说明琼斯把处个各个位置上的队友结合球变得更有威胁性。篮板和传球对于任何控卫的技能储备来说都是很重要的技能，尤甚于一名打算成为板凳匪徒的球员。

Jones showed brief flashes — a nice pass, a made three, a strong finish around the hoop — on offense that made it seem like he has a bright future in the league, but those flashes became much dimmer on the other end of the court where he often struggled to keep his man in front of him. His biggest weaknesses are his size, lack of athleticism, and speed, and all of those factors combine to cause his trouble on defense; this was evident in an early March game against the San Antonio Spurs as point guards Andre Miller andPatty Mills blew past him on multiple occasions.

琼斯展现出来短暂的优势 - 不错的传球，命中三分球，在身体对抗下篮筐附近的的终结能力，这些让他看上去会在这个联盟有着光明的未来，但是这些闪光点在球场的另一侧会变得更加模糊，琼斯经常在面对面前的球员表现出来挣扎。琼斯最大的短板就是他的个子，缺乏身体对抗，速度，所有这些因素组合起来导致他在防守上会顾此失彼；在三月初面对圣安东尼奥马刺的控卫安德烈弥勒和帕塔里克米尔斯多次过人时尤为明显。

Jones will have to rely on his basketball smarts to make up for his deficiencies on the defensive end going forward. Jones had a defensive rating of 111 and a defensive box plus/minus of -2.0, both of which are pretty terrible, but there is a hope that new head coach Tom Thibodeau can work magic with him. Thibodeau has a history of turning undersized, low-level talent backup point guards into very serviceable players (Aaron Brooks, E'Twaun Moore, Nate Robinson, D.J. Augustin, etc.), so who is to say the same can't be done with Jones?

琼斯未来不能不利用他的篮球智商去弥补他在防守端的不足。他的防守在整个联盟中排名111位，防守正负值-2.0,两项都非常糟糕，但是现在希望来了，新的主教练锡伯杜能够改变他。踢波杜有这调教小个子的历史，将一些天赋不那么初中的替补控卫打造成一个合格的轮换球员（阿隆·布鲁克斯、伊托万·摩尔、内特·罗宾逊以及D.J.奥古斯丁还有很多），所以谁说这些不能发生在琼斯身上呢？

This mostly goes without being said, but Jones will also have to grow into his body a little more, and adding strength would be a good thing. As David pointed out in his article for SB Nation's rookie week, Jones just isn't strong enough at this point to fight around screens. However, he is only 19 years old, so he has plenty of time to fill out his frame and figure out how to play defense to compensate for his physical limitations.

不言而喻，琼斯的身体还会发育长大一点，增强力量将会是一个不错的选择。正如David为SB Nation撰写的文章中指出，琼斯在这个观点中，琼斯还远不够强壮在比赛中持续对抗，但是他只有19岁，他有足够多的是将去充实他的骨架，想明白如何弥补他的身体缺陷去做好防守。

So what, exactly, do the Wolves have in Tyus Jones? It is difficult to say at the moment, but from what he has shown, it would appear as if the Wolves have a young point guard with a need to grow and improve his defense, but who also boasts a high basketball IQ, a work-in-progress three-point shot, and the passing ability and court vision to put his teammates in the best position to succeed. The Wolves don't need Jones to be a savior of the franchise or even to become a starter someday; what the franchise needs from Jones is for him to become a reliable backup, a role that is instrumental and of the utmost importance for a team wanting to win a championship.

那么，森林狼到底从泰厄斯-琼斯这得到了什么？现在还很难说，但是从小伙子的表现来看，森林狼似乎拥有了一个需要变得更强壮，改进防守，但是用着很高的篮球智商，能够出其不意的投中三分球，同时有着出色的传球能力，在球场上视野能搞帮助队友在更好的位置得分，这样一个年轻的控球后卫。森林狼不需要琼斯去成为这个城市的救世主，亦或者某一天成为进攻的发起者；但是这座城市真正需要的是穷时能够成长为一名可靠的替补球员，争冠球队中一块至关重要的拼图。

So why not make Jones the primary backup point guard now? While it is possible that he may not be completely ready for that role for some of the reasons listed above, the best way to earn valuable experience is to see in-game action; practice and learning from the bench can only bring you along so far. Being the primary backup would allow for Jones to learn how to roll with the punches and learn on the fly; let him take his lumps and allow for him to grow as the season progresses.

所以为什么不让琼斯现在就成为主要的替补控卫呢？虽然可能由于上述的一些原因他现在还没有完全准备好去扮演这样第一个角色，但是只有在球场上才是获取经验最有效的途径；在板凳上练习和学习只会让他在这条路上越走越远。让琼斯成为主要的替补轮换能够让他学会如何应对困难，快速学习；让让能够越挫越勇，随着赛季进行不断成长。

Now this isn't to say that the Wolves don't need to acquire a third point guard this offseason. They must, but taking a look at the point guards who will be available this summer in free agency, most are either young and looking to get paid (read: overpaid) or are veterans who are on the verge of either being washed up or are already there. Ideally, it would be best if the Wolves were to bring on a veteran on a one-year deal who could either split time with Jones as the primary backup early in the year before conceding the title to Jones as the season progressed or who wouldn't mind playing 10 minutes or so a game. From that list linked earlier, only 38-year-old Jason Terrysomewhat fits that description and, even then, he is more of a shooting guard anyway.

但是这不意味着这森林狼不需要在休赛期寻找第三名控卫。管理层必须在这个夏天着眼于寻找合适的司职控球后卫的自由球员，大多是寻求薪酬的年轻球员，或者是等待机会或者刚合同到期的老兵。理想情况下，森林狼最好能够以一年期的短合同签下一名这样的老球员，在琼斯证明能力前能够分担轮换阵容的出场时间，或者不介意每场打10分钟左右。从上面这个名单上来看，只有38岁的老将杰森特例某种程度上符合我们形容的，即使情况已经这样了，唯一符合条件特里还更像一个得分后卫。

So, again, why not give Jones the title now? Ultimately the decision lies in the hands of Thibodeau, but Jones has the potential to be a very solid backup point guard and it will be interesting to see how he improves under the new regime.

所以，再再说一句，为什么不现在就给琼斯更多的出场机会呢？最终的决定权在蟋蟀手里，但是琼斯的的确确有潜力成为一名可靠的替补控卫，那会非常有趣将会看到在新的教练体系中他能够提升自我至何种程度。
